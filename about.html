                <p>The Arts Council is a team of individuals who show a passion for the arts and wish to create a culture that is inclusive, intuitive and interactive. Art houses many abilities within its umbrella so we have encouraged a range of talents to join the council and strengthen the creative community within our school. We have the responsibility to spread music, dance, literature and theatre as well as visual forms of arts like painting, sculpture, architecture, etc, to Rototuna High Schools.</p> <!--The p tag is for text that holds the main content of a web page, here being about the arts council.-->
